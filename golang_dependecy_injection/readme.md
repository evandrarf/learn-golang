# LEARNING RESTFUL API WITH GOLANG

In this repository, I have created a case study for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product entries using Golang. This is an implementation of my learning outcomes in the Go programming language.

### How to Run

Make sure you have Docker installed on your computer.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

For the API spec, check out [api-spec.yml](apispec.yml) OpenAPI file
